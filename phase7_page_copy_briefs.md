  SECTION 2 - What is Sublimation? (250-300 words):
    HEADLINE: What is Dye-Sublimation? (The Unlimited Design Method)
    PURPOSE: Explain sublimation technology clearly
    USER QUESTION: "What does 'sublimated' actually mean?"
    CONTENT TO INCLUDE:
      - Simple explanation:
        → "Dye-sublimation is a printing process where designs are dyed directly into the fabric using heat"
        → "The ink becomes part of the jersey material, not a layer on top"
      
      - How it works (step-by-step):
        1. Design is printed onto transfer paper using special inks
        2. Transfer paper is placed on polyester fabric
        3. Heat press (400°F) transforms ink from solid to gas
        4. Ink permanently bonds with fabric fibers
        5. Result: Vibrant, permanent design that won't crack or peel
      
      - Key characteristics:
        ✓ Unlimited colors (no extra charge for complexity)
        ✓ Photo-quality detail possible
        ✓ Lightweight (no added material weight)
        ✓ Won't crack, peel, or fade (design is IN the fabric)
        ✓ Breathable (no barrier layer)
      
      - Visual aids:
        → Diagram showing sublimation process
        → Close-up photo of sublimated jersey showing detail
        → Before/after comparison
      
      - Best for:
        → Complex multi-color designs
        → Gradients and photo elements
        → Budget-conscious teams
        → Youth/recreational leagues
        → Creative beer league designs
    
    KEYWORDS TO INCLUDE: sublimation, dye sublimation, how sublimation works

  SECTION 3 - What is Stitching/Tackle Twill? (250-300 words):
    HEADLINE: What is Tackle Twill Stitching? (The Traditional Pro Method)
    PURPOSE: Explain stitched jersey construction
    USER QUESTION: "What does 'stitched' or 'tackle twill' mean?"
    CONTENT TO INCLUDE:
      - Simple explanation:
        → "Tackle twill is the traditional method where fabric layers are cut and stitched onto the jersey"
        → "This is how NHL and pro teams make their jerseys - dimensional and durable"
      
      - How it works (step-by-step):
        1. Design elements are cut from colored twill fabric
        2. Pieces are layered to create the logo/numbers
        3. Each piece is stitched onto the jersey base
        4. Multiple stitching passes for durability
        5. Result: Raised, dimensional design with pro look
      
      - Key characteristics:
        ✓ Dimensional (raised/3D feel)
        ✓ Traditional "pro hockey" aesthetic
        ✓ Extremely durable (5+ years)
        ✓ Heavier than sublimated (more fabric layers)
        ✓ Limited to 2-4 colors (cost increases with complexity)
      
      - Visual aids:
        → Diagram showing tackle twill layers
        → Close-up photo showing stitched detail
        → Side-angle photo showing dimension
      
      - Best for:

        → Competitive/rep teams
        → Teams wanting "NHL look"
        → Long-term investment (5+ year lifespan)

        → Example: 15-jersey team order:
           • Sublimated: $675-975 total
           • Stitched: $1,125-1,425 total
           • Savings: $450-450 with sublimation
        
        **DESIGN FREEDOM:**
        → Sublimated: Can have photo backgrounds, gradients, unlimited colors
        → Stitched: Limited to 2-4 solid colors, simple geometric shapes
        → Example: Team wants rainbow gradient background = MUST be sublimated
        
        **DURABILITY:**
        → Both last 2-5 years with proper care
        → Sublimated: Dye won't fade, but fabric can wear
        → Stitched: Fabric + stitching extremely durable, but stitches can fray if snagged
        
        **WEIGHT:**
        → Sublimated feels like regular jersey (one layer)
        → Stitched has extra twill layers (heavier, warmer)
        → For summer ball hockey: Sublimated is better (breathability)
        
        **AESTHETIC:**
        → This is subjective!
        → Sublimated: Modern, vibrant, "new school"
        → Stitched: Classic, traditional, "old school pro"
        → Ask yourself: Do we want to look like an NHL team (stitched) or create unique designs (sublimated)?

    PURPOSE: Set realistic expectations, provide care instructions
    USER QUESTION: "How long will these jerseys last?"
    CONTENT TO INCLUDE:
      - Durability expectations:
        
        **SUBLIMATED:**
        - Typical lifespan: 2-3 years heavy use (3-4 games/week)
        - What wears out: Fabric itself (not the design)
        - The design (dye) never fades, cracks, or peels
        - Fabric can develop pilling or wear at stress points
        
        **STITCHED:**
        - Typical lifespan: 3-5 years heavy use
        - What wears out: Stitching can fray if snagged
        - Fabric is thicker/more durable than sublimated
        - Proper care prevents fraying
      
      - Care instructions for both:
        
        **WASHING:**
        - Turn jerseys inside out
        - Machine wash COLD water (never hot)
        - Use gentle/delicate cycle
        - Use mild detergent (no bleach)
        
        **DRYING:**
        - Air dry or tumble dry LOW heat
        - Never use high heat (damages fabric/stitching)
        - Remove from dryer while slightly damp
        
        **SPECIAL NOTES:**
        - Sublimated: Avoid fabric softener (reduces breathability)
        - Stitched: Check for loose threads after washing, trim if needed
        - Both: Don't dry clean (unnecessary and can damage)
      
      - Lifespan tip:
        → "We've seen sublimated jerseys last 5+ years and stitched jerseys last 8+ years with proper care. The key is cold water and low heat!"
    
    KEYWORDS TO INCLUDE: durability, care instructions, lifespan

  SECTION 9 - FAQ (300-400 words):
    HEADLINE: Sublimated vs Stitched: Your Questions Answered
    PURPOSE: Address remaining objections/questions
    CONTENT TO INCLUDE:
      1. "Can sublimated jerseys fade over time?"
         → "No! The dye is permanently bonded to the fabric. It won't fade, crack, or peel even after 100+ washes. What wears out is the fabric itself, not the design."
      
      2. "Can stitched jerseys come loose or fray?"
         → "With proper care, rarely. We use reinforced stitching and high-quality thread. If a stitch does come loose, it's easily repairable."
      
      3. "Which is lighter?"
         → "Sublimated jerseys are lighter because there's no added fabric layers. Stitched jerseys have tackle twill layers that add 10-15% weight."
      
      4. "Can I mix sublimated and stitched on one team?"
         → "Technically yes, but we don't recommend it. They look different side-by-side. Better to choose one for team uniformity."
      
      5. "Which looks more professional?"
         → "Subjective! Stitched looks like NHL/pro teams (traditional). Sublimated looks modern and vibrant. Both are high-quality."
      
      6. "Can you do stitched numbers with sublimated jerseys?"
         → "Yes! We can combine methods. Example: Sublimated jersey body with stitched tackle twill numbers. Best of both worlds (extra cost applies)."
      
      7. "Which is better for goalies?"
         → "Either works! Goalies often prefer stitched for the pro look and extra durability. But sublimated is fine for rec leagues."
      
      8. "Can I see examples of both before deciding?"
         → "Yes! Use our jersey builder to see both styles. Or request sample photos from our team."
      
      9. "What if I choose wrong?"
         → "We provide detailed mockups before production. 99% of teams get it right on first try. If you're unsure, call us - we'll guide you."
