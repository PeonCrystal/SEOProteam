<h1>Sublimated vs Stitched Hockey Jerseys: The Complete Comparison</h1>

<p>Choosing between <strong>sublimated and stitched hockey jerseys</strong> is one of the biggest decisions your team will make when ordering custom uniforms. Both are excellent options — but they look different, feel different, cost different, and work best in different situations. This guide breaks down everything you need to know so you can make the right call for your team.</p>

<h2>What Are Sublimated Hockey Jerseys?</h2>

<p><strong>Sublimated hockey jerseys</strong> are made using a heat-transfer process called dye sublimation. The design is printed onto a special paper, then heated until the ink turns into a gas that bonds permanently with the polyester fabric fibres. The result is a jersey where the colour literally becomes part of the fabric — not a layer sitting on top of it.</p>

<h3>How Sublimation Looks and Feels</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Look:</strong> Smooth, vibrant, and flat against the fabric. Colours are vivid and can include gradients, photo-quality images, and complex patterns.</li>
  <li><strong>Feel:</strong> Lightweight and smooth to the touch. There are no raised areas — the printed surface feels identical to the rest of the jersey.</li>
  <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Lighter than stitched jerseys. The fabric is breathable polyester mesh without additional layers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sublimation Durability</h3>

<p>Because the dye is infused into the fabric fibre itself, sublimated designs <strong>will never crack, peel, fade, or wash away</strong>. You can machine wash sublimated jerseys hundreds of times and the colours stay as vibrant as day one. The fabric itself will wear out before the print does.</p>

<h2>What Are Stitched Hockey Jerseys?</h2>

<p><strong>Stitched hockey jerseys</strong> use a traditional construction method where names, numbers, logos, and design elements are individually cut from twill or felt material and then sewn directly onto the jersey body. This is the same method used in professional leagues — NHL, AHL, OHL, and other top-tier competitions.</p>

<h3>How Stitching Looks and Feels</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Look:</strong> Classic, layered, and textured. Letters and numbers are raised off the jersey surface, creating depth and a premium visual impact.</li>
  <li><strong>Feel:</strong> Heavier and more substantial than sublimated jerseys. The raised elements give the jersey a tactile, high-end feel.</li>
  <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Noticeably heavier due to the multiple layers of fabric sewn onto the base jersey.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stitching Durability</h3>

<p>Stitched jerseys are extremely durable when constructed properly. The sewn-on elements hold up well through physical play and washing. However, individual stitches can loosen over time with heavy use, and edges may lift if subjected to frequent snagging. Proper care — washing inside out on gentle cycle — extends the lifespan significantly.</p>

<h2>Cost Breakdown: Sublimated vs Stitched</h2>

<p>Sublimated jerseys are generally the <strong>more affordable option</strong> because the production process is faster and doesn't require individually cutting and sewing each element. With sublimation, even complex multi-colour designs don't add to the cost.</p>

<p>Stitched jerseys carry a <strong>premium price</strong> due to the labour-intensive process of cutting, layering, and sewing each name, number, and logo. The more elements on the jersey, the more stitching work required.</p>

<p>Both options include free design, free revisions, and free shipping at Pro Team Jerseys. Contact us for specific pricing based on your team's order.</p>

<h2>Durability and Care: Which Lasts Longer?</h2>

<p>Both jersey types are built to last multiple seasons when cared for properly.</p>

<h3>Sublimated Jersey Care</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Machine wash cold or warm — the print can handle it</li>
  <li>Tumble dry low or hang to dry</li>
  <li>No special care requirements</li>
  <li>Expected lifespan: 3–5+ seasons with regular use</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stitched Jersey Care</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Wash inside out on cold/gentle cycle</li>
  <li>Hang to dry is recommended to preserve stitching</li>
  <li>Avoid snagging on equipment during removal</li>
  <li>Expected lifespan: 3–5+ seasons with proper care</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Third Option: Tackle Twill</h2>

<p>Can't decide? <strong>Tackle twill hockey jerseys</strong> offer a middle ground.
