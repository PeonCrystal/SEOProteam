<h1>Custom Hockey Jerseys Canada — Sublimated, Stitched, and Tackle Twill</h1>

<p>Order <strong>custom hockey jerseys in Canada</strong> from Pro Team Jerseys. We build fully customized, game-ready hockey uniforms using sublimation, stitching, or tackle twill — delivered free to every province. No minimums, free design service, and pricing in Canadian dollars with zero cross-border fees.</p>

<h2>Three Ways to Build Your Custom Hockey Jerseys</h2>

<p>Not every team needs the same type of jersey. We offer three customization methods — each with its own look, feel, and price point. Not sure which is right for your team? Read our <strong>sublimated vs stitched comparison guide</strong> for the full breakdown.</p>

<h3>Sublimated Hockey Jerseys</h3>

<p><strong>Sublimated hockey jerseys</strong> use a dye process that bonds colour permanently into the fabric fibre. The result is unlimited colour options, complex artwork, gradients, and photo-quality graphics with zero cracking, peeling, or fading.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unlimited colours at no extra cost</li>
  <li>Lightweight, breathable polyester mesh</li>
  <li>Colours won't crack, peel, or wash out</li>
  <li>Best for: beer league teams, recreational leagues, tournaments, creative designs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stitched Hockey Jerseys</h3>

<p><strong>Stitched hockey jerseys</strong> deliver the premium, textured look you see in professional leagues. Names, numbers, and logos are individually cut and sewn onto the jersey for a raised, tactile finish with a heavier, traditional weight.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Professional raised lettering and numbering</li>
  <li>Heavier, traditional weight and feel</li>
  <li>Premium pro-level look and texture</li>
  <li>Best for: competitive rep hockey, organizations wanting a professional finish</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tackle Twill Hockey Jerseys</h3>

<p><strong>Tackle twill hockey jerseys</strong> bridge the gap between sublimated and fully stitched. Twill letters and numbers are heat-applied and stitched down for a polished, durable look that holds up through seasons of physical play.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clean, professional appearance</li>
  <li>Durable heat-applied and stitched construction</li>
  <li>Middle ground between sublimated and fully stitched</li>
  <li>Best for: minor hockey associations, house leagues, teams wanting a clean pro look</li>
</ul>
