<h1>Custom Hockey Jerseys Built for Your Team</h1>

<p>Pro Team Jerseys is Canada's source for <strong>custom hockey jerseys</strong> — designed, built, and shipped to your team's exact specifications. Whether you need sublimated, stitched, or tackle twill jerseys, we deliver pro-quality uniforms with no minimums, free design service, and free shipping across Canada.</p>

<h2>Your Team Deserves Better Than Off-the-Rack</h2>

<p>Generic jerseys don't build team identity. Your squad needs a look that's uniquely yours — one that players are proud to pull on before every game. <strong>Custom ice hockey jerseys</strong> from Pro Team Jerseys give you complete control over every detail: colours, logos, names, numbers, fonts, and construction style.</p>

<p>We serve beer league teams, minor hockey associations, rep programs, men's league squads, and tournament teams across Canada, the USA, and Europe. From a single replacement jersey to a full multi-team association order — we handle it all.</p>

<h2>Choose Your Jersey Construction</h2>

<h3>Sublimated Jerseys</h3>

<p>Full dye <strong>sublimated hockey jerseys</strong> with unlimited colours, photo-quality graphics, and zero cracking or fading. Lightweight, breathable, and the most affordable option for teams that want bold, creative designs.</p>

<h3>Stitched Jerseys</h3>

<p>Premium <strong>stitched hockey jerseys</strong> with raised lettering and numbers sewn directly onto the jersey. The classic pro look and feel, built for teams that want a traditional, high-end finish.</p>

<h3>Tackle Twill Jerseys</h3>

<p>Heat-applied and stitched <strong>tackle twill hockey jerseys</strong> that combine durability with a clean, polished appearance. The middle ground between sublimated and fully stitched.</p>
