<h1>Hockey Jersey Builder — Design Your Custom Team Jerseys Online</h1>

<p>Use our <strong>hockey jersey builder</strong> to design your team's custom look in minutes. Choose your sport, pick a template, and customize every detail — colours, logos, names, numbers, and more. Our online <strong>hockey jersey customizer</strong> gives you full creative control with a free professional proof included on every design.</p>

<h2>How the Online Hockey Jersey Builder Works</h2>

<p>Our <strong>online hockey jersey builder</strong> walks you through the entire design process step by step. No design experience required — just pick your options and we handle the rest.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Choose Your Sport and Jersey Style</h3>

<p>Start by selecting your sport — <strong>hockey, baseball, or softball</strong>. Then choose your jersey style from our template library. Every template is fully customizable, so use it as a starting point and make it your own.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hockey</strong> — classic striped, modern, vintage, and minimalist cuts</li>
  <li><strong>Baseball</strong> — full-button, two-button henley, and pullover options</li>
  <li><strong>Softball</strong> — athletic-cut jerseys in women's and men's fits</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: Select Your Colours</h3>

<p>Choose from an <strong>unlimited colour palette</strong>. Because we use full dye sublimation, there are no restrictions on the number of colours — and no extra cost for additional colours. Pick primary, secondary, and accent colours to match your team's identity.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Upload Your Team Logo</h3>

<p>Drop your <strong>team logo or crest</strong> directly into the jersey customizer. We accept PNG, JPG, AI, EPS, and PDF formats. Don't have a high-res logo? Our design team can recreate or enhance your artwork at no charge.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add Names, Numbers, and Details</h3>

<p>Customize <strong>player names, jersey numbers, captain letters, and alternate captain designations</strong>. Choose from multiple fonts and number styles. You can also add:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sponsor logos on sleeves, chest, or back</li>
  <li>Memorial patches or league crests</li>
  <li>Custom text, taglines, or year established</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 5: Submit and Get Your Free Proof</h3>

<p>Once your design looks right in the <strong>hockey jersey customizer</strong>, submit it for review. Our design team refines your mockup into a <strong>polished, print-ready proof</strong> and sends it back for approval. This step is free, and you get unlimited revisions until the design is exactly right.</p>

<h2>Tips for Getting the Best Results from the Jersey Builder</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use vector logos</strong> — AI, EPS, or SVG files produce the sharpest print results</li>
  <li><strong>Keep contrast high</strong> — names and numbers should be clearly readable against the jersey colour</li>
  <li><strong>Consider both sides</strong> — think about how the front and back designs work together</li>
  <li><strong>Don't worry about perfection</strong> — our designers clean up and optimize every submission before production</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Makes Our Hockey Jersey Builder Different</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>True unlimited colours</strong> — sublimation means no colour count restrictions or upcharges</li>
  <li><strong>Professional design review</strong> — every builder submission gets refined by our design team</li>
  <li><strong>Unlimited free revisions</strong> — we don't finalize until you're completely satisfied</li>

</ul>
