<h1>How to Use Our Custom Jersey Design Tool</h1>

<p>Our online <strong>jersey design tool</strong> makes it easy to create your team's custom look in minutes. Choose your sport, pick a template, and customize every detail — from colours and logos to player names and numbers. Here's how it works, step by step.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Select Your Sport and Jersey Style</h2>

<p>Start by choosing your sport — <strong>hockey, baseball, or softball</strong>. Then select your preferred jersey style from our template library. Each template is fully customizable, so think of it as a starting point rather than a final design.</p>

<p>Available styles include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hockey</strong> — classic, modern, and vintage jersey cuts</li>
  <li><strong>Baseball</strong> — full-button, two-button henley, and pullover options</li>
  <li><strong>Softball</strong> — athletic-cut jerseys in women's and men's fits</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 2: Choose Your Colours</h2>

<p>Select from an <strong>unlimited colour palette</strong> to match your team's identity. Because we use full dye sublimation, there are no restrictions on the number of colours in your design — and no extra cost for additional colours. Pick your primary, secondary, and accent colours to build a look that's uniquely yours.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Add Your Team Logo and Crest</h2>

<p>Upload your <strong>team logo or crest</strong> directly into the design tool. We accept most image formats including PNG, JPG, AI, EPS, and PDF. Don't have a high-resolution logo? Our design team can recreate or enhance your artwork at no extra charge.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Customize Names, Numbers, and Details</h2>

<p>Add <strong>player names, jersey numbers, captain letters, and alternate captain designations</strong>. Choose from a variety of fonts and number styles to complete your look. You can also add:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sponsor logos on sleeves, chest, or back</li>
  <li>Memorial patches or league crests</li>
  <li>Custom text or taglines</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 5: Review and Submit Your Design</h2>

<p>Once you're happy with your design in the tool, submit it for review. Our design team will refine your mockup into a <strong>polished, print-ready proof</strong> and send it back for your approval. This step is free, and you can request unlimited revisions until the design is exactly right.</p>

<h2>Tips for Getting the Best Results</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use high-resolution logos</strong> — vector files (AI, EPS, SVG) produce the sharpest results</li>
  <li><strong>Keep contrast in mind</strong> — names and numbers should be easily readable against your jersey colour</li>
  <li><strong>Think about both sides</strong> — consider how the front and back of the jersey work together</li>
  <li><strong>Don't worry about perfection</strong> — our design team cleans up and optimizes every submission</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prefer to Skip the Design Tool?</h2>

<p>If you'd rather not use the online tool, that's fine too. You can <strong>email us your concept</strong> — whether it's a rough sketch, a photo of an old jersey, or just a written description of what you want — and our design team will create a professional mockup from scratch at no cost.
