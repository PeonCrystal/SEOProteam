<h1>Place Your Custom Jersey Order</h1>

<p>Ready to order <strong>custom jerseys</strong> for your team? Here's everything you need to know about placing an order with Pro Team Jerseys — from design to delivery. We make the process simple, transparent, and stress-free.</p>

<h2>How to Place Your Order</h2>

<h3>Option 1: Use Our Online Design Tool</h3>

<p>Our <strong>jersey design tool</strong> lets you build your custom look right in your browser. Select your sport, choose a template, add your colours, logos, and player details, then submit your design for a free professional proof.</p>

<h3>Option 2: Send Us Your Concept</h3>

<p>Prefer a hands-off approach? <strong>Email us your idea</strong> — a sketch, a reference image, a description, or even a photo of an old jersey you want to replicate. Our design team will create a professional mockup from scratch at no cost.</p>

<h2>What Happens After You Submit</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Design proof</strong> — within 1–2 business days, we send you a polished digital mockup of your jerseys for review</li>
  <li><strong>Revisions</strong> — want changes? No problem. We offer <strong>unlimited free revisions</strong> until the design is exactly how you want it</li>
  <li><strong>Approval</strong> — once you approve the final proof, your order moves into production</li>
  <li><strong>Production</strong> — jerseys are produced in approximately 3–4 weeks using full dye sublimation</li>
  <li><strong>Shipping</strong> — completed jerseys are shipped free to your door (Canada and USA)</li>
</ol>

<h2>What You Need to Provide</h2>

<p>To get your order started, have the following ready:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Team name and logo</strong> — vector files (AI, EPS, SVG) are ideal, but we can work with most formats</li>
  <li><strong>Colour preferences</strong> — specific colours or a general direction you'd like</li>
  <li><strong>Player roster</strong> — a list of names, numbers, and sizes for each jersey</li>
  <li><strong>Sponsor logos</strong> — if applicable, any partner or sponsor artwork to include</li>
  <li><strong>Design references</strong> — optional, but helpful if you have examples of looks you like</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pricing and Payment</h2>

<p>Pricing depends on the type of jersey and quantity ordered. There are <strong>no setup fees, no art charges, and no colour surcharges</strong> — those are all included. Contact us or use our design tool for an instant quote based on your specific order.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>No hidden fees</strong> — the quoted price is the price you pay</li>
  <li><strong>No minimum order</strong> — order one jersey or one hundred</li>
  <li><strong>Volume discounts available</strong> — larger orders receive better per-unit pricing</li>
</ul>
