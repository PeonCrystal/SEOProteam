<p>Not sure which style is right for your team? Read our detailed <strong>sublimated vs stitched hockey jerseys</strong> comparison for a full breakdown of the pros, cons, and best use cases for each.</p>

<h2>Materials and Construction</h2>

<h3>Sublimated Jersey Materials</h3>

<p><strong>Sublimated hockey jerseys</strong> are made from pro-weight polyester mesh that is breathable, moisture-wicking, and built for game play. The sublimation process infuses dye directly into the fabric fibre at a molecular level — meaning colours become a permanent part of the jersey. There is no surface layer that can crack, peel, or wash away, even after hundreds of machine washes.</p>

<h3>Stitched Jersey Materials</h3>

<p><strong>Stitched hockey jerseys</strong> use a heavier polyester base with individually cut twill or felt pieces for names, numbers, and logos. Each element is sewn directly onto the jersey with reinforced stitching — the same construction method used in professional leagues. The result is a raised, tactile finish that looks and feels premium.</p>

<h3>Tackle Twill Materials</h3>

<p><strong>Tackle twill hockey jerseys</strong> feature heat-applied polyester twill that is then stitched down for additional durability. This gives you the clean, layered look of stitched construction with a flatter profile and slightly lower price point.</p>

<h2>Full Customization Options</h2>

<h3>Colours</h3>

<p>Sublimated jerseys support <strong>unlimited colours</strong> at no extra charge — including gradients, fades, and complex patterns. Stitched and tackle twill jerseys use our standard colour range for twill and thread, covering all major team colours.</p>

<h3>Logos and Crests</h3>

<p>Upload your team logo in any format (AI, EPS, SVG, PNG, JPG, PDF). We place your crest on the chest and can add shoulder patches, back logos, and sleeve branding. Don't have a logo? Our design team can create or enhance one at no extra charge.</p>

<h3>Names and Numbers</h3>

<p>Choose from multiple <strong>font styles and number designs</strong>. Every jersey gets individual player names and numbers. Captain (C) and alternate captain (A) letters are included at no additional cost.</p>

<h3>Sponsor Logos</h3>

<p>Add sponsor branding to sleeves, chest, back, or helmet. We integrate sponsor logos seamlessly into your design — just send the artwork and tell us where you want it.</p>
